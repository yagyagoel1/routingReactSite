                <p>"Vanilla CSS" refers to the use of plain, standard CSS without any preprocessor or additional libraries. It's the traditional way of writing and styling web pages using the core features of CSS, as specified by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). When people say "vanilla," they are often drawing a comparison with other flavors or variations, such as: Vanilla JavaScript: Similar to the concept in CSS, "vanilla JavaScript" refers to using pure, standard JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks. Vanilla HTML: This term is less commonly used, but it would refer to writing standard HTML without any templating languages or additional layers. In the context of CSS, using "vanilla CSS" means working directly with the features and syntax provided by the CSS language itself, without utilizing tools like Sass, Less, or CSS-in-JS solutions. While preprocessors and additional tools can provide convenience and extra functionality, vanilla CSS remains fundamental and widely used for styling web pages.</p>
